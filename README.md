Based on the tik tok trend where you try and guess the order of the cups.

play_game is for playing the game. Also tried out one strategy called the greedy strategy which
can always get the right sequence in 5 guesses. (But you will know the sequency after the 4th guess).

There might be a better strategy. But haven't been able to find it yet.
Interested to see how things are different for 6 cups instead of 4 cups. Also if you start adding extra rules.
Like you must move at least 3 cups for each guess. Another question is what the average or expected number of guesses are for a strategy and what the minimum number is.
Also maybe there is a strategy that is easier to remember and doesn't involve keeping track of exactly which combinations are left.
